/*
This Rust program is designed to be compatible with wasm on Ethereum and make API calls to the Amazon Marketplace Web Service. It consists of four main functions: place_order, check_inventory, check_price, and order_more_inventory.

The place_order function calls the Amazon Marketplace API to place an order on behalf of a customer. It takes in an Order struct, which contains the product being ordered and the quantity, as well as an API key. It returns an OrderStatus struct, which contains the unique identifier of the order and its current status. To use this function, you can pass in an Order struct and an API key as arguments. The function will return an OrderStatus struct if the API call is successful, or an error if the call fails.

The check_inventory function calls the Amazon Marketplace API to check the inventory for a product. It takes in a product ID and an API key as arguments, and returns an Inventory struct, which contains the unique identifier of the product and the current quantity of the product in the inventory. To use this function, you can pass in a product ID and an API key as arguments. The function will return an Inventory struct if the API call is successful, or an error if the call fails.

The check_price function calls the Amazon Marketplace API to get the details of a product. It takes in a product ID and an API key as arguments, and returns the price of the product as a f64. To use this function, you can pass in a product ID and an API key as arguments. The function will return the price of the product if the API call is successful, or an error if the call fails.

The order_more_inventory function calls the Amazon Marketplace API to update the inventory for a product. It takes in a product ID, the quantity to be ordered, and an API key as arguments, and returns an empty tuple if the call is successful. To use this function, you can pass in a product ID, quantity



Continue 

to be ordered, and an API key as arguments. The function will return an empty tuple if the API call is successful, or an error if the call fails.

In addition to these main functions, the program also includes several structs and utility functions to facilitate the API calls. The Product struct represents a product in the Amazon Marketplace, with fields for the product name, price, and quantity. The Order struct represents an order placed by a customer, with fields for the product being ordered and the quantity. The OrderStatus struct represents the status of an order, with fields for the order's unique identifier and current status. The Inventory struct represents the inventory of a product, with fields for the product's unique identifier and current quantity.

The program also includes a main function that demonstrates how to use the main functions to make API calls to the Amazon Marketplace Web Service. This function reads the Amazon Marketplace API key from the environment and reads the product ID and order quantity from the command line arguments. It then calls the get_product function to retrieve the details of the product, creates an Order struct with the product and quantity, and calls the place_order function to place the order. It also calls the check_inventory function to check the inventory for the product and prints the result to the console, and calls the update_supply function to manage the supply of the product.

To use this program in a wasm environment on Ethereum, you will need to compile the Rust code to wasm and then deploy the wasm contract to the Ethereum network. You will also need to have an API key for the Amazon Marketplace Web Service, which can be obtained by signing up for the service and creating an API key. With these resources in place, you can call the main functions of the program to make API calls to the Amazon Marketplace Web Service and perform the desired actions.
